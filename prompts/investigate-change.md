# Investigate Change

The orchestration hub invokes this prompt. The founder does not select investigation skills or identify technical files.

## Instructions

- Read shared agent rules, canonical project documents, the founder communication contract, and the active OpenSpec change.
- Confirm repository, branch, and exact change being investigated.
- Default to read-only and do not modify files, commit, deploy, or access production data.
- Use approved repository-aware clarification or domain-analysis skills only when routed by the orchestration hub.
- Do not make product or architecture decisions.
- Inspect the current user and data flow, relevant architecture, reusable components, tests, authentication, authorization, tenancy, migrations, security, privacy, and likely regression surface.
- Identify questions that need founder judgment separately from technical questions answerable through inspection.
- Recommend a bounded implementation surface without expanding scope.
- Map durable output into `repository-report.md`; do not create a competing specification or issue system.

## Founder-facing return

Before the technical report, provide a concise explanation following `docs/FOUNDER_COMMUNICATION.md`.

Explain:

- Where the project stands after the investigation
- Why the findings matter
- What was discovered
- What the system should do next
- What the founder needs to decide or do
- The recommended action and reason

End with:
