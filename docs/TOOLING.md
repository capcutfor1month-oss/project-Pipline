## Skill governance

The canonical external-skill policy lives in `docs/SKILLS.md`.

Approved libraries are capability sources, not mandatory context. Select the smallest relevant skill set for the current stage and task.

### Default stage routing

- Discovery: PM discovery skills plus `grill-with-docs`
- Strategy: PM strategy, value proposition, assumptions, and red-team skills
- Specification: PM PRD, roadmap, user-story, and test-scenario skills plus `to-prd` and `to-issues`
- Implementation: `tdd`, `codebase-design`, and domain modelling when needed
- Debugging: `diagnosing-bugs` plus a regression test
- Launch: product-marketing context, customer research, copywriting, CRO, signup, analytics, and launch skills
- Growth: SEO, experiments, retention, referrals, pricing, email, SMS, social, sales enablement, and revenue operations only when relevant

## Token-efficiency rule

Reserve Claude for implementation. Use scripts, GitHub Actions, Gemini CLI, or OpenCode for exploration, repetitive checks, and log summarization.

Load skills lazily. Do not copy or inject entire upstream libraries into every project or conversation.

## Tool-selection rule

Do not use every tool or skill for every change. Scale the pipeline according to risk, stage, and actual need.
